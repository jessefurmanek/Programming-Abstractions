So I ball so hard muhfuckas wanna find me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a muhfuka like me
Can you please remind me?
Ball so hard
This shit crazy
Ya'll don't know that don't shit phase me
The Nets could go 0-82 and I look at you like this shit gravy Ball so hard,
This sh*t weird
We ain't even spose to be here,
Ball so hard, Since we here
It's only right that we be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to be go Michael
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard
Got a broke clock, Rolleys that don't tick tok
Audemars that losing time, Hidden behind all these big rocks
B-ball so hard
I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
Ball so hard
Let's get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
Ball so hard
Bitch behave, Just might let you meet Ye,
Chi towns D. Rose, I'm movin' the Nets to BK.
